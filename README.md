# f-blog
A simple WordPress plugin to import your Facebook page feed into your blog

## Setup

Copy the plugin into your WordPress Plugin directory and enable it in the Admin Dashboard.
Then you can configure your Page-ID and Token in the menu. See http://developer.facebook.com/ for more information.

## Cron

The plugin will register a job in wp-cron which runs daily. This behaviour is currently hard-coded.
